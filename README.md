## ðŸ“„ Project Description

**Problem Solved:**  
This project simulates how a server processes incoming requests using the **First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)** scheduling algorithm. It helps visualize request handling order and compute key OS-level performance metrics like waiting and turnaround times.

**Inputs Required:**  
- Arrival Time  
- Processing Time (Burst Time)  
- (Request IDs are auto-generated)

**Outputs Generated:**  
- Waiting Time for each request  
- Turnaround Time for each request  
- Start and Completion Time of each request  
- Average Waiting and Turnaround Time  
- Server Utilization  
- Gantt Chart of request execution

**Implementation Summary:**  
The FCFS algorithm is implemented in Python using lists and basic control structures. Requests are sorted by arrival time, then processed sequentially. Metrics are calculated during execution. **Matplotlib** is used for Gantt chart visualization, and **Tabulate** for tabular output formatting.

## ðŸ§¾ Code Structure & Explanation

**Functions Used:**

- `get_requests_input()` â€“ Accepts and stores request arrival and processing times  
- `fcfs_schedule()` â€“ Performs FCFS scheduling and calculates all timing metrics  
- `display_request_table()` â€“ Displays the final scheduling results in a table  
- `draw_gantt_chart()` â€“ Visualizes execution using a Gantt chart  
- `calculate_metrics()` â€“ Computes averages and utilization  

**Core Logic:**

- Requests are sorted by **arrival time**  
- Server processes requests in order using a **current time tracker**  
- If the server is idle, it waits until the next request arrives  
- Metrics like **waiting time**, **turnaround time**, and **utilization** are calculated per request  

**External Libraries Used:**

- `matplotlib` â€“ For Gantt chart plotting  
- `tabulate` â€“ For neatly formatted console tables

## ðŸ“Š Performance Metrics

| Metric                    | Value (Example) |
|--------------------------|-----------------|
| Average Waiting Time     | e.g., 3.33       |
| Average Turnaround Time  | e.g., 6.67       |
| Total Idle Time          | e.g., 2          |
| Server Utilization (%)   | e.g., 83.33%     |
| Time Quantum (if RR)     | Not Applicable  |

## ðŸ›  Challenges Faced

1. **Accurate Time Tracking**  
   - **Challenge:** Handling idle periods where the CPU must wait  
   - **Solution:** Used `max(current_time, arrival_time)` to start processing properly  

2. **Maintaining Request Identity**  
   - **Challenge:** Ensuring request IDs stay aligned after sorting  
   - **Solution:** Encapsulated each request as a dictionary with ID included  

3. **Correct Metric Calculation**  
   - **Challenge:** Validating turnaround and waiting times  
   - **Solution:** Verified with manual test cases and step-by-step debugging
